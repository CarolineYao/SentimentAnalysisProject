#Contributing to Us

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

The code submit and test process is still under developing. For now, the only needed steps are regular fork and PR. If you are not familiar with it, this [repo](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)
is a good trial for the beginners.
